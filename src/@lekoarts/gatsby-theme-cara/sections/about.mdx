## About

> We view game design and development as a form of play. It's the ultimate medium for expressing once creative whims. But it's hard, and so one of our goals is to make it a little bit easier. Both for ourselves and for others.

We :heart: Open-Source, and as such all of our tooling, including the code, base model, and datasets for Ducky AI are Open-Source. We also plan to give %5 of our revenue back to the Godot Engine project, without which we couldn't exist!
